Backbone-Webpack-Route-Splitting
==
A quick example of code splitting on route using Backbone.js and Webpack 3

While I use `yarn` as a package manager in this project, this could be done with any node-based Webpack build system.

# Getting Started

1. Install node (recommended through nvm).
  1. If you installed via nvm, run `nvm use`
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start a development server on http://localhost:8080
4. Profit ðŸ’¸!
